# Scripts for SoftwareAG provisioning contexts

## General Rules applied

The project is built so that scripts may be downloaded or injected into linux nodes, either hosts, vms or containers.

The scripts themselves have minimal comments to keep them light.

All files that require parameters are managed with gnu envsusbst. This means that all properties will be sourceable shell files.

### Template variables

By convention, the wmscript templates will contain lines such as the following one when dealing with variables. Templates built before this convention are deprecated. Whnever a key contains a point (`.`) it is substituted with underscore (`_`)

```sh
key=${WMUI_WMSCRIPT_Key}
```

example

```sh
InstallDir=${WMUI_WMSCRIPT_InstallDir}
```

## Important notes

It is the caller responsibility to:

- properly cater for env variables substitutions in the provided files.
- properly prepare url-encoded variables (use the common lib primitives)

## Exit $ Return Codes

|Code|Description|
|-|-|
|0|Success|
|1|Cannot create Session folder|
|100|One of the expected files is missing from product installation|
|101|Environment variables substitutions failed for a template file|
|102|curl failed|
|103|setupProductsAndFixes failed for local setup|
|104|offline mode prerequisites not met|

## Return codes

By convention all functions must return 0 if successful. Return codes then will be specific to each function

## Notes

For the moment everything works with version 10.5 and Update Manager v11. The scripts are also follwoing a "use before reuse" principle, reusability with other versions will be evaluated when the need manifests.
